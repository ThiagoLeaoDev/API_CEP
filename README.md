> Project developed for the web development activity of Universidade Santa Cec√≠lia, whose objective was to consume an end point of an external api, using the &#34;Fetch&#34; method, at first it was only necessary to search for the address through the typed CEP, however I decided to add a map where I pass the code inside an Iframe and render it on the screen, I also decided to make it responsive for all devices.


## Usage

```
Download the project, open it in the text editor, host it locally (the most used way is using the "live server"), and it
will be ready for use!
```
